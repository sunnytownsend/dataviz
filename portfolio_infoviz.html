		<h1>Data and map visualisations</h1>
		<p>Visualising complex analyses: a board of statistical graphics I have created for papers and grant applications using R. These are related to my work on rabies, largely on vaccination strategies to eliminate a recent epidemic on the island of Bali.</p>

		<p>Visualising complex ideas: Figure from Townsend et al. paper in preparation for submission to PLOS Computational Biology entitled 'Quantifying sources of infection in vaccinated populations using a pseudo-marginal Bayesian approach' illustrating the the MCMC simulation algorithm. Letters correspond to details in the paper's methods. Figure prepared using R for the graphs and powerpoint.</p>
